So I think my list will be a bit mainstream, but these are the most important films in my life.\nThere is nothing more scary then the monsters you can only see in your imagination, but Ridley Scott, H.R. Giger, Carlo Rambaldi and co managed to pull off the impossible in Alien: when they finally show their creature, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t just meet but exceeded our fears.\nAnchorman provided thousands and thousands of pub quotes. It was trendsetting, refreshingly absurd and unbelievably funny, and said much about the time and place in which it was made.\nDuel is not just one of the greatest movie metaphors (machines kill their people), for me it\xe2\x80\x99s the greatest suspense thriller ever. The claustrophobic shots are a masterclass.\nAfter the most successful film ever made, Lucas pulled off a very daring, very dark sequel in The Empire Strikes Back. It\xe2\x80\x99s so alive, with an ending so shocking I almost fainted.\nWith Miller\xe2\x80\x99s Crossing the Coens made a musical gangster satire so complex it even gave those geniuses writer\xe2\x80\x99s block (which they made into Barton Fink, another masterpiece).\nJim Jarmusch and his little stories of drama and comedy in Night On Earth are like life itself. It\xe2\x80\x99s so natural that I imagined myself into the backseat of these taxis. This is pure movie magic, and much better than any special effects.\nOnce Upon a Time in the West is an elegy about the death of men and their principles, the dying breath of an era and a genre orchestrated to the sound of a harmonica.\nThe Terminator is supposed to be a B movie, with lots of action and some sex, but it turned out to be a mindboggling and thought-provoking experience, with such dynamism and speed that the film seemed like time travel itself.\nThe Thing is not just a monster movie with unbelievably good effects but one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time, presenting a fresh allegory about a disease hiding in men called AIDS. (Is the Thing a leaving, breathing creature or just a virus?)\nThe greatest trick The Usual Suspects ever played is that you can rewatch it over and over and still not know whether Keyser Soeze really exists or is just a myth. A very rewarding film indeed.\nSo there it is, my favorite ten films of all time \xe2\x80\x93 not the groundbreaking ones, not the tentpoles, just the films and movies that made me a film fanatic.'"

First, in order to be considered as one of the greatest, movies should always look for new ways of cinematic expression or should try to analyse, to reflect on the problems, possibilities and boundaries of representation. Second, it is also important that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t become a purely formal innovation, so it should also be able to have an emotional and/or intellectual effect on its viewer through its thematic content \xe2\x80\x93 it should deal with relevant issues. And the third criteria is about a film\xe2\x80\x99s contemporaneity in 2012: I chose films that didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem outdated, obsolete neither in their formal or thematic treatment, irrespective of their year of production.'"
