We love films neither for the reproduction of real life nor for the entertainment, but for the appearance of the human being. \nRashomon shows us impossibility of understanding the world and the inability of discovering the truth \xe2\x80\x93 those are, at first sight, European existential values, but they were brought to cinema by its Eastern film director.\nEverything became possible in cinema because Wild Strawberries appeared. Again, I choose it not for the entertainment purposes, but as a reflection of fantasies and human imagination. \nLe Notti di Cabiria has absolute genuineness and an attachment to human soul. Neorealism, in my opinion, is the basis of cinema as art. \nLand of Fathers is one of the best Soviet films of the \xe2\x80\x98Thaw\xe2\x80\x99 period. It has not gained worldwide audience because distributing Kazakh films was prohibited during Soviet times. The dialogue of civilisations, an examination of archetypes, finding yourself and your roots \xe2\x80\x93 all of these are in the film. \n\xe2\x80\x9cHuman needs human\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 this is Goethe\xe2\x80\x99s phrase as said by Snaut in Solaris, a film of psychologism, philosophy, aesthetic film language and direct emotions. \nGabbeh is a cinematographic anthem of love, nature and life. The story is set in \xe2\x80\x98heaven on earth\xe2\x80\x99; its director brought primordial beauty to love. \nBeshkempir: The Adopted Son displays the Central Asian mentality in contemporary film language. For me, this is the first film that revived my childhood feelings and emotions. \nThe Matrix is a bright image of Buddhist duality and an imaginary replica of the people of the western hemisphere; Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring\xe2\x80\xa6, meanwhile, also reflects Bhuddist philosophy in the bright visual images and in its portrayal of the path that a human being takes in overcoming himself.\nThis is the reflection of Bhuddist philosophy in the bright visual images and reflection of the path that human being is undertaking in overcoming himself.'"

I could easily have put in another two each for Bresson and Tarkovsky, it felt like betrayal to leave out several of Kieslowski's and a couple of Fellini's (La Strada in particular which had a big effect on my development as a filmmaker), and there are some more recent films which perhaps would be on the list if I'd had more time to live with them.I'm glad to be able to include a title from Bill Douglas\xe2\x80\x99s autobiographical trilogy which I've discovered only in the last few years but which I keep going back to. Taken together, these three films are an immense aesthetic and moral achievement and deserve to be much better known."""

Some of them might not be historically important but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure most inspired numerous filmmakers in many ways.

Ten best Biograph shorts by D.W. Griffith; ten best Hollywood animations from the 1940s; ten best experimental films from the 1960s; ten best Finnish films; ten best films of 1914 or 2012: justice would be possible in lists like them. I think there are on the average ten masterpieces per year in the history of the cinema. I wrote a book on the 1,000 best feature films for the centenary of the cinema and a new edition of it on the 1,100 best films for the 110th anniversary. I could include any of them in this top ten list. And many more short films.\n\n\tCity Lights: Still maturing after the passing of the golden age of comedy Chaplin moves towards heartbreaking self-reflection.\xe2\x80\xa8\n\n\tLa R\xc3\xa8gle du jeu: Mozartian depths beneath a superficial frivolity.\xe2\x80\xa8\n\n\tCitizen Kane: There are a dozen reasons to like this. One is an enormous joy of the cinema. \xe2\x80\xa8\n\n\tMy Darling Clementine: A new gravity and dignity appears in Ford\'s Westerns after WWII.\xe2\x80\xa8\n\n\tSansho dayu: Like Ford, Mizoguchi was a master of both the epic and the lyrical. In this story of injustice he is at his most ardent.\xe2\x80\xa86. Smultronst\xc3\xa4llet. A purely cinematic journey of self-discovery, worthy of Chekhov and Strindberg. Also the most beautiful hommage in the history of the cinema, in this case to Victor Sj\xc3\xb6str\xc3\xb6m and The Phantom Carriage, Bergman\'s personal favourite film.\xe2\x80\xa8\n\n\tJules et Jim: Like Design for Living (No\xc3\xabl Coward / Ernst Lubitsch), an anti-triangle-drama: the saga of a friendship between two men and a woman. The title notwithstanding the central character is Catherine, immortalized by Jeanne Moreau. Also a rich period movie starting from la belle \xc3\xa9poque and reaching to the eve of WWII. Full of life and an irresistible love for the means of the cinema.\xe2\x80\xa8\n\n\tKahdeksan surmanluotia/Eight Deadly Shots: Together with Loviisa (1946, Valentin Vaala) and Tuntematon sotilas/The Unknown Soldier (1955, Edvin Laine), this is one of the best Finnish films by a classical director, but only in its full version of 5 hours and 16 minutes.\xe2\x80\xa8\n\n\tThe Mirror: A space odyssey into the interior of the psyche, Tarkovsky\'s ""In search of lost time"". Epic dimensions of history emerge during this personal journey through the memories of childhood.\n\n\tSpirited Away: There is an affinity between animation and animism. Miyazaki, a master on the level of Lewis Carroll and Tove Jansson, creates a unique vision in which old spirits coexist with the modern world.'"

You can do it in the simplest way, choosing the ones you feel are the best films \xe2\x80\x93 always, in our own opinion, following a logical and unappealable criteria, but fanciful and incomprehensible to everyone else. Another possibility is to impose certain rules. Personally, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always believed in choosing those films that, as Serge Daney said, saw me grow up. Or to express it in another way, films that grew up with me.\nIn the mid-1970s Argentineans found their cinematographic education in neighborhood movie theatres with their double-features; cinephilia came to me together with the Video Club explosion during the 1980s. I was part of Generation VHS and, for the first time, film history was available to anyone. The old guardians of cinephilia saw their ancient, secret knowledge tested by young people who consumed non-stop every film that fell into their hands. Low-budget horror films, classics films\xe2\x80\xa6 whatever. Part of this list comes from that ignoble place \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps not actual film choices, but a certain atmosphere.\nBy the mid-1990s, TV cathode rays had defined the cinephilia of a generation, just as film festivals were reborn in our country. Film festivals: another place where films became more democratic, where many movies that did not reach commercial distribution (almost always the best ones) were, at least for a while, available to all audiences. And from here comes another restriction to this list: to choose only films that I have seen, at least once, in movie theaters.\nThe last rule I followed to get to my final ten films comes from Corto Malt\xc3\xa9s\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98The Ballad of the Salty Sea\xe2\x80\x99: \xe2\x80\x9cTo remain in the past, as you do, is like guarding a graveyard.\xe2\x80\x9d As nobody wants \xe2\x80\x93 I think \xe2\x80\x93 to have that task, I tried as hard as I could to move away from the past, or to keep it present as a kind of tool that will help me to better understand the future.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery rule wants to destroy its exception,\xe2\x80\x9d Jean-Luc Godard said.

It\xe2\x80\x98s not simply political. It has a documentary feel to it, which makes it convincing and strong.L'avventura marks the point I crossed in my adolescence when my understanding of cinema transformed from social issues to more personal and existential ones. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of those magical experiences where a seemingly everyday experience actually becomes meaningful and deep. It shifted my focus from plot to character development. It felt modern, contemporary and somehow more mature in its individualism.Solaris taught me a story can be spiritual without being about spirituality. It\xe2\x80\x99s powerful in its indirectness and contemporaneity.The Passion of Joan of Arc taught me film could be just poetry and timeless.The Swimmer is a film that makes me come back to it again and again in my life. I have to watch it once every five years. It\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful and modern metaphor of life \xe2\x80\x93 an amazing blend of the classical metaphor of the river as life and the swimming pool as life \xe2\x80\x93 structure, interruption, artificiality, which makes it very American.Among the films I saw recently, Melancholia marked me the most. I love stories that tell a story without directly telling it. To me, it talks about the nature of melancholia in a very indirect way, so that the story becomes completely something else, almost to the point of breaking away from the original starting-point, where in fact it doesn't matter anymore. It simply becomes pure cinema.Breathless: Pure Godard."""

Only ten! Impossible. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to leave out so many excellent films, so many excellent directors from the silent period, or people like John Ford, Howard Hawks, Alfred Hitchcock and Billy Wilder (my heroes), Orson Welles (yes, I am afraid I am not going to include Citizen Kane, although it is indeed a great film), Dassin\xe2\x80\x99s Rififi, Truffaut, Fellini, Woody Allen (Annie Hall!), Ozu or Kurosawa, without forgetting \xe2\x80\x9call those bright young men and women\xe2\x80\x9d from the former Eastern Europe: Wajda, Munk, Kieslowski, Forman, Menzel, Chytilov\xc3\xa1, Szabo, Meszaros, the Soviet filmmakers. And Tarkovski; and Bu\xc3\xb1uel. And the list can go on and on and on and on. As a film historian I should give an objective list covering the key moments in the history of cinema, but I am, above all, a spectator, so, I am afraid, this list is a rather personal one. So\xe2\x80\xa6 Not only was L\xe2\x80\x99Arrive d\xe2\x80\x99un train en gare one of the first films to have a proper audience, but it also does not matter how many times I watch it, I still find it mesmerising. Any of Chaplin\xe2\x80\x99s silent films could have received the vote. Anyway, I am not going to go for City Lights or any of his features, but for one of his two-reelers at the Mutual, The Rink. I have The Last Laugh as I feel it is not only Murnau\xe2\x80\x99s best film but also because it is one the pinnacles of the silent period in terms of developing a purely visual language. With L\xe2\x80\x99avventura Antonioni went back to the silent masters by using dialogue sparsely and developing a different type of story, supported by the visuals and sounds. I could have also chosen La Notte (1960) or L\xe2\x80\x99eclisse (1962). Nothing really happens in Intimate Lighting, just two old friends meeting and catching up after so many years. Perfect. Persona is the best example of what B\xc3\xa9la Bal\xc3\xa1zs termed as the \xe2\x80\x98dimension of physiognomy\xe2\x80\x99. Together with Nykvist, Andersson and Ullman, Bergman explores the soul behind the mask. In My Night with Maud, Eric Rohmer meets Nestor Almendros meets Jean-Louis Trintignant meets Fran\xc3\xa7oise Fabian\xe2\x80\xa6 The Spirit of the Beehive displays Erice\xe2\x80\x99s mastery when it comes to developing a dialogue between the spectator and the filmmaker: he makes the spectator a participant of the creative process or, to paraphrase his words, he encourages the spectator to experience the same path down which the director has previously walked. And Luis Cuadrado\xe2\x80\x99s cinematography is stunning. The Conversation is one of those before-and-after films; Walter Murch experiments with sound design. I have to include a more contemporary film, otherwise I would be one of those grumpy old men who thinks cinema is dead, so 2046 is it. Wong Kar Wai is one of the greatest filmmakers in terms of knowing, absorbing, blending and developing the hundred and so odd years of cinema.'"

But I\xe2\x80\x99ll choose Otto e Mezzo because of its poetic aesthetic. The story of lonely filmmaker Guido Anselmi, lost in his memories and dreams, is very beautiful. I love the mix between fantasy and reality, the black-and-white scenes and the foolish narration of Fellini. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fantastic, artistic movie.\nI have a great admiration for Pier Paolo Pasolini. I can say that he is really a global artist. He was poet, writer, journalist and film director. I think that Salo is his most violent and most radical movie, in which he explores the links between political corruption and sexual perversion. The narrative structure of the film is amazing. We must remember that it was the last movie Pasolini made before his assassination.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m very interested by the situation of autistic persons and I\xe2\x80\x99ve been very touched by the role hold by Dustin Hoffman in Rainman as Raymond Babbitt. He was absolutely incredible as this character.\nAs a playwright, I know what it means for an actor to be on stage and to hide his feelings and troubles when he is in the skin of a character. Opening Night shows with a great skill the dark side of the theatre, and Gena Rowlands is phenomenal in the role of Myrtle Gordon, this big Broadway star who must continue to act, despite the horror of the scene she has witnessed.\nTaxi Drives sees a big, big, big, unforgettable Robert de Niro brilliantly directed by a big, big Martin Scorsese in a very tough psychological thriller \xe2\x80\x93 one of the best of his kind.\n Contempt is a beautiful opus to Nouvelle Vague cinema, and one of Godard\xe2\x80\x99s most experimental movies. I love his troubled and troubling narration, his obsession with breaking the codes of popular cinema using some typical Godardian tropes: minimal dialogues with strange gestures, stares and situations. It\xe2\x80\x99s intellectual as usual but also aesthetically different and courageous. \nThe Passenger is one of Antonioni\xe2\x80\x99s best movies, especially with its famous last sequence: a seven-minute-take tracking shot around the hotel where David Locke (John Nicholson) is dead.\nThe most spectacular performance of Tom Cruise\xe2\x80\x99s career as is in Born on the Fourth of July as Ron Kovic, a veteran of the Vietnam War who goes home in a wheelchair and begins a new struggle against the politics of the United States in Vietnam.\nIn the west, people know almost nothing about Algerian cinema but Inland is the best movie ever made in my country. It\xe2\x80\x99s a film about the effects of the civil war in the deep countryside, a very beautiful road movie with fantastic scenes and a radical aesthetic.'"

As for what guides the choices, I feel that until now most good cinema has come from outside those cultural conventions that we call \xe2\x80\x98western\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 from where the medium has forever been welcomed as a magical visitor from nowhere. The films chosen here best live up to the wildly experimental and playful ways in which cinema was meant to be engaged with.'"

More powerful, more stirring and dynamic than 50 action films.\nTron is about the videogame culture of its time, and about the future those games and that technology would bring; it opened a window onto the visual spectacle of contemporary CGI and the camera CG-Eye.

It\xe2\x80\x99s the culture of the drive-in, the date; it\xe2\x80\x99s allowed to be gauche and naive, to try to be cool, to go through stupid fashions and hopeless crushes.

Since Markopoulos\xe2\x80\x99 death in 1991, his companion and heir, filmmaker Robert Beavers, has been printing it whenever possible, but only a handful of the film\xe2\x80\x99s sections, or \xe2\x80\x98Orders\xe2\x80\x99, have yet been shown. I have seen all of Order II and Order V, and about half of Order III. Any one of them alone would be at the top of my list, so on faith I list the entire film. My inclusion of India is based on the Cin\xc3\xa9math\xc3\xa8que Fran\xc3\xa7aise print I viewed in 1970, which had reasonably good colour. I don\xe2\x80\x99t get much from the recent restoration. If the new print is all that will ever be shown, I would list Rossellini\xe2\x80\x99s The Messiah instead. I constructed my list by first determining my favorite filmmakers, and then limiting myself to one film by each. My criteria have been entirely aesthetic. The focus in such lists on the value of individual films as separated from their makers\xe2\x80\x99 oeuvres is, in my view, more than a little dubious, and is altogether too much of a piece with the object-oriented, consumerist nature of our culture. One gains much more from considering a filmmaker\xe2\x80\x99s output whole, and it is considered this way that, I believe, my choices will make the most sense. Each great filmmaker uses film language in a unique way, and each film helps one learn how to see the others. A major filmmaker\xe2\x80\x99s work also offers a more expansive vision than does any film taken individually. Thus I would prefer that an interested viewer see any ten films by a single filmmaker on my list rather than one by each. Mizoguchi\xe2\x80\x99s Genroku Chushingura, for example, is not necessarily greater, and certainly not more emotionally affecting, than Sansho Dayu, but it has both a uniqueness and a perfection different from that found in his later films, a comparison that only becomes clear when one has seen many. Eniaios is perhaps the most purely cinematic of films. Other arts are major inspirations, to be sure, but the film itself, with its flash frames and solid blacks and whites alternating in amazingly architectural rhythms (I thought, among other things, of classical temple columns separated by sky) can stand for, and in some ways surpass, what is best about the greatest films: a rhythmically pulsating rectangle of light. It attains an all-encompassing hugeness unparalleled in any other film I know. Mizoguchi attains an ineffable spatial perfection, raising to sublimity the weight of human emotion, history and some sense of emptiness. Rossellini\xe2\x80\x99s world-encompassing vision in India is unique in his work. Brakhage\xe2\x80\x99s Egyptian Series attains a level of abstraction beyond even that of his \xe2\x80\x98Romans\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Arabics\xe2\x80\x99, shifting clouds of textured light conveying qualities that have no verbal equivalents. L\xe2\x80\x99Argent is a terrifying mechanism, a vision of horrible inevitability, an emptying out that surpasses even other Bresson films. Schwechater, which is only one minute in length, is one of the most perfect, ecstatic and amazingly complex of constructions. Naruse\xe2\x80\x99s late \xe2\x80\x98Scope films are perhaps his greatest, being indescribably moving even while avoiding the emotionalised visual expressions of so many melodramas to instead create an unbiased openness to the world. It is hard to choose a best Hawks \xe2\x80\x93 his visual style seems to grow from the tiniest of character gestures to patterns of space and light that parallel the organicity of bodies in space. While Seven Women is in some ways the greatest Ford, The Sun Shines Bright combines a depth of vision with a perfection of narrative that perfectly matches Ford\xe2\x80\x99s visual evocations of honour, community, memory and loss. As with most of the other films on my list, Robert Breer\xe2\x80\x99s many short masterpieces have yet to receive their proper recognition, but he achieves a cinematic intensity unlike any other filmmaker, combining flicker, color, line and depth paradoxes that underline the artificiality of film space, together with a humour that underlines absurdities. The vision that he achieves is transformative.'"

They should be in every list! \nThere are films I have a very strong relation with (Sunrise, Viaggio in Italia, The Mother and the Whore), which became part of my life and whose characters stayed with me.\nThere are films that are particularly relevant at this precise moment of my life (Some Come Running, Modern Times). They both deal with the body and space. They both work in term of rhythm and music. They are both so full of life that they make me laugh and cry. \nThen I added some films that explain where I came from. During my activities as film critic I devoted part of my time to animation and documentaries. So I choose one very classic animated film that is extremely powerful in terms of its realism (Graves of the Fireflies) and one documentary that is a sort of map of the 21st century (Amsterdam Global Village). \nFinally, I choose a title (Yi YI) that I saw only once at the Cannes Film Festival, yet the feeling of it remained with me powerfully throughout this last decade. I choose it as a tribute to the role of film festivals (for me, the best way to discover new and old films), as well as to the man who made the film. \nI must admit there is one film that was expelled at the last moment to let Modern Times in: Jean Vigo\xe2\x80\x99s 1934 film L\xe2\x80\x99Atalante (another specimen of the second group).

The internet is convulsed with macho and tribal criticisms of top ten and top 100 lists of this nature. Yet against my expectations I have found this to be a useful exercise. Why, for example, do I have so few American films in my top ten? I would dearly like to have added a Robert Altman film \xe2\x80\x93 especially Nashville and The Long Good Friday \xe2\x80\x93 or a good screwball comedy, probably Preston Sturges\xe2\x80\x99 The Lady Eve. If I had to add an Orson Welles, it would be The Magnificent Ambersons. \nThere are many others \xe2\x80\x93 the inevitable Renoirs and Ozus, but I prefer Bresson and Mizoguchi in each case. I would like to have included Hou Hsiao-hsien, or possibly an Eric Rohmer, especially since the soundscape of the latter\xe2\x80\x99s Brittany beaches always propels me back to my childhood. Others will take care of the big beasts of 1970s cinema \xe2\x80\x93 Scorsese and Coppola \xe2\x80\x93 and I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel any great need to revisit them. Someone such as Werner Herzog deserves a mention for his whole output and an outstanding contribution to film culture in general \xe2\x80\x93 he\xe2\x80\x99s become almost a folkloric figure. Ang Lee has similarly made a great contribution for his synthesis of eastern and western sensibilities. His Wedding Banquet is one of the great modern farces.\nAs to my actual top ten, I have the following observations. I am aware that there is an intersection between favourite films and good films, the classic error of the amateur critic. Just because I like a film it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it good, it just means it pushes a few buttons. In the case of Mizoguchi and Bresson I could have chosen almost any of their films. Sokurov is uneven in his output, but I still find the swoop of his Russian Ark as astounding as the first day I saw it. Choosing Pasolini\xe2\x80\x99s Arabian Nights, which along with Porcile is his least-regarded film, might be seen as deliberately perverse, but it seems to me his happiest and prettiest film. Jan \xc5\xa0vankmajer\xe2\x80\x99s Alice, along with F.W Murnau\xe2\x80\x99s Nosferatu, seem to have an almost occult force to them and give the sensation that they are accessing areas of imagination very few other films do. To a lesser extent, the same can be said of Lynch\xe2\x80\x99s Mulholland Dr. On the other hand, Yi-Yi seems to me one of the most sublimely humane and conscious films ever made, containing no bells and whistles \xe2\x80\x93 the loss of Edward Yang after his early death in 2007 remains one of the greatest blows to modern cinema in recent times. His A Brighter Summer\xe2\x80\x99s day was also in consideration for this top ten. \nBut in general the films that mean the most to me are often films that resemble dreams or aspire to a dream state. Fanny & Alexander is an example of this. Film, especially approached in the darkness of a theatre, seems to me the nearest thing we have to a waking dream, with all the treasures and unfolding secrets that entails. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say these films are necessarily in an order, but I do find Tarkovsky\xe2\x80\x99s Andrei Rublev to be a film that still enchants and intrigues. There is something about the warp and weft of his film, and its attempt to understand the nature of the votive and the creative, that seems to me cinematic poetry of the highest order.'"

I discovered that cinema could do something different to the double bills on Thursdays. I discovered that it could speak about real people and their emotions and conflicts. And it determined my film vocation.Singin\xe2\x80\x99 in the Rain is the pinnacle of the American musical but above all, it is a work that gives you a burst of energy, of vitality. I have watched it so many times and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never felt disappointed. Its images (and its music numbers) are very powerful. And the actors are genius in this history of cinema within cinema. \n\xc2\xa0\nThe first time I watched Pierrot le Fou it was a life experience. It generated a disturbing emotion within me. It is an existential, anarchic, melancholic, desperate film. I like the use of music with the abrupt entrances, and the use of primary colours: blue, red, yellow.With North by Northwest, Hitchcock invented a genre. He added humour to suspense and the result is excellent. The film is hypnotic; you cannot stop watching it (not even if you know it by heart) because the central idea (genius) and the outcome are at the same level. It\xe2\x80\x99s full of memorable sequences later imitated to death.Psycho is a really strange black and white film where the protagonist dies halfway through. The viewer is left puzzled yet absorbed in the story. Unforgettable images: the shower, the stairs, the mansion\xe2\x80\xa6 What a risky and daring film!\n\xc2\xa0\nThe opening shot of Touch of Evil is a whole film course in itself. This low-budget film reveals Welles the inventor at his best. The images create a unique world. He uses sequence shots as long as five minutes, full of tension and magic, and turns American stars (Heston and Leigh) into Shakespearean characters. The final touch is provided by the great Henry Mancini\xe2\x80\x99s jazzy music. \n\xc2\xa0\nI was conquered on a second viewing of 8\xc2\xbd. This is a very personal film, which would be unthinkable today. Fellini reveals himself in the character played by Mastroianni and creates his universe somewhere between the real and the dreamt. The music by Nino Rota seems to have been composed before Fellini\xe2\x80\x99s images; the latter fit like a glove with the score. \n\xc2\xa0\nBergman\xe2\x80\x99s were some of the very few Films with a capital letter that were allowed by Franco\xe2\x80\x99s censorship in the \xe2\x80\x9960s and The Seventh Seal was the first of his films to show in Spain. I saw it when I was 16, and the image of the knight playing chess with death remains engraved in my memory.\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\nA statement against the death penalty made by outwitting Franco\xe2\x80\x99s censors, The Executioner is an attack on the moral misery of a cunning and corrupted society. And everything told through the prism of black humour very characteristic of Berlanga and his co-writer, Rafael Azcona. Berlanga invented long sequence shots that allow the actors to walk about freely.Bu\xc3\xb1uel found in Mexico the right setting to display his genius. In Los Olvidados he mixes in a surprising way the social with the surreal. This film is at the same level as The Exterminating Angel.'"

The sound, visuals and ideas within allow us to get lost in a progression of thought and concept that fully challenges our every sense. One of the most referenced films since it was made, 2001: A Space Odyssey is pushes the lengths to which cinema can go in every capacity.\nThat Errol Morris\xe2\x80\x99 filmic investigation into the case of death row inmate Randall Dale Adams\xe2\x80\x99 saved his life by proving his innocence marks only one of The Thin Blue Line\xe2\x80\x99s many achievements. Creating a new style of storytelling through both reconstruction and reflective narrative, Morris broke new ground with the presentation of both historic and non-fiction investigative filmmaking.\nShirley Clarke\xe2\x80\x99s Portrait of Jason is a much too unsung masterpiece of documentary cinema. The beautifully non-intrusive approach creates a captivating and striking means to allow the viewer to directly engage in one man\xe2\x80\x99s story of race and sexuality in the 1960s. \nDr. Strangelove is the pinnacle of political satire, and one that continues to remain prophetic and relevant. A stunning performance from Peter Sellers utilises a multitude of comedic levels to create a humorous and self-devouring warning to mankind. \nChris Marker\xe2\x80\x99s use of ideas and imagery in Sans Soleil will be imitated for decades to come. His exploration and essayistic style explored new possibilities in forming narratives and the ability to immerse viewers into a different relationship between sound and image.\nDo the Right Thing utilises a multitude of cinematic techniques to show a microcosm of a culture and world that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been shown on screen at the time of its release. It continues to serve as an important example of the effect of strong storytelling and technical craft in putting forward political and social issues through film.\nAn example of how film can act both as a vital record of a moment and as a self-reflective medium, Gimme Shelter is superbly crafted to allow audiences to not only witness the events of the Rolling Stones\xe2\x80\x99 tragic Altamont concert, but also to view to the Stones\xe2\x80\x99 own reaction to the events. By turning the medium on itself, Gimme Shelter creates a comment only on the culture of the time and on the recollection and the reaction of cinema.\nMaintaining its allure to this day, Man with a Movie Camera stands witness to an evolution of cinema as it happened. The curiosity of the filmmaker radiates through every frame in its exploration of all aspects of life and cinema.\nPlay Time shows the beauty and power of subtlety in both cinema and comedy. The nuances of performance and craft create a world that feels like no other but whose effect is universal to audiences. \nA thriller whose use of dialogue and suspense is unparalleled, North By Northwest subdues traditional ideas of the genre to create a new style of its kind. That any number of its scenes remain iconic is a testament to Hitchcock\xe2\x80\x99s incredible directing prowess. This calibre of visual style, along with the use of subtlety and tone, make North by Northwest one of the most intriguing and beguiling thrillers ever made.'"

The list is therefore a hybrid one, patchworked from different perspectives and, all in all, a sort of elusive compromise that includes: the canonical films I am not allowed to skip; my favourite films \xe2\x80\x93 those that determined film studies would be my professional domain \xe2\x80\x93 that I would not like to skip; and the films that dominate contemporary production through various forms of intertextuality (references, citations, allusions, homage, tributes).\nBicycle Thieves is neo-social realist melodrama that verges on tragedy, a document of devastated post-war Italy. Its delicate treatment of the (cinematic) space is recognised both in Bazin\xe2\x80\x99s and Deleuze\xe2\x80\x99s writings. Even today, stolen bicycles pass through world cinema from China to Belgium (Gamin a velo).\nIs it possible to make list top ten list without Citizen Kane? Daring, innovative, a turning point in many ways, it is still fascinating and fresh even after 70 years, thanks to its mise en sc\xc3\xa8ne, narrative structure and self-consciousness.\nThe contrast of cultures and relativisation of the American Dream is most emotionally resonate in the first part of Coppola\xe2\x80\x99s family saga The Godfather. However, the majority would rightfully choose Godfather: Part II.\nImitation of Life is definitely a must see. It\xe2\x80\x99s probably the best melodrama of 20th century (comparable perhaps only with Griffith\xe2\x80\x99s Orphans of the Storm) and the peak of Sirkian irony. It is an inevitable point of reference in dealing with melo EDQUESTION \xe2\x80\x93 WHAT? and central to the dense intertextuality of the genre. Eventually, it is a metaphor for cinema itself.\nIvan\xe2\x80\x99s Childhood is a poignant story of the little soldiers, echoing lost childhoods from Sciusci\xc3\xa0 to 400 Blows. Its emotionalism puts the ideology under erasure, EDQUESTION \xe2\x80\x93 WHAT? sketching the eternal otherness of eastern Europe. \nJules et Jim is Truffaut\xe2\x80\x99s masterpiece. Its essential Frenchness EDQUESTION \xe2\x80\x93 CUT SENTENCE HERE THAT MADE NO SENSE comes through in cinematic images.\nThe refrain of the title song of Singin\xe2\x80\x99 in the Rain echoes as far as A Clockwork Orange (Kubrick), while the narrative structure and meta-dimension are mirrored in The Artist. One of the best tributes to classical Hollywood and an entertaining musical.\nTranscendental style and minimalistic cinema can be found in the Japanese melodrama Tokyo Story. It strikes a delicate balance to become a subtle, poetic work of offscreen space.\nUnderground is the cinematic text of barbarogenius EDQUESTION \xe2\x80\x93 WHAT? A visually opulent and metaphorically multilayered summary of Balkan history, it is densely saturated with references and homages to world cinema history from Vigo to Tarkovsky, Fellini and Sasa Petrovic. Furthermore, it has been an influence on, mainly, European directors of later generations.\nAnother title to be found on similar lists is Vertigo, the ultimate psychoanalytical work about obsession, illusion, guilt and fear. It is immortalised, also, in theoretical analysis as the narrative film offering \xe2\x80\x98visual pleasure\xe2\x80\x99.'"

That makes this list somewhat nostalgic, as does the fact that these particular favourites were shot on film and not digital. I don\xe2\x80\x99t hate digital, and recent features from the likes of David Fincher and David Lynch are just a few of the reasons why. But film taught me to love the movies, and it\xe2\x80\x99s film that I love. It\xe2\x80\x99s crushing and incomprehensible that film will vanish within my lifetime, forced into obsolescence by the greed and the shortsightedness of a movie industry that\xe2\x80\x99s aided in its anti-film campaign by the unsettling indifference and ignorance of too many critics.\nThe movies will continue, but right now my list feels a little like a dispatch from a nearly lost world.

The camera moving across the pale faces and shadows in the opening of Flowers of Shanghai \xe2\x80\x93 the first of 39 shots in the film. Saint Francis shushing the birds so that God can hear him while he prays (\xe2\x80\x9cMy little brothers, you can praise God so easily, because you\xe2\x80\x99re free to fly through the air so pure.\xe2\x80\x9d). The parallel structure of The Godfather Part II, with Vito ascending and Michael descending; the way the young Clemenza stands pointing his gun at the silhouette of a policeman, evoking the codified gestures in silent cinema and underlining Coppola\xe2\x80\x99s two other histories (the Corleone\xe2\x80\x99s, cinema\xe2\x80\x99s). Jack Smith in the bathtub in Little Stabs at Happiness and Ken Jacobs in voiceover (\xe2\x80\x9cAlmost no one in this film do I see anymore\xe2\x80\x9d). \xe2\x80\x9cThis wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the film we dreamed of,\xe2\x80\x9d the doomed boy says in Masculin f\xc3\xa9minin. \xe2\x80\x9cThis wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the total film that each of us had carried within himself [sic], the film that we wanted to make or, more secretly, no doubt, that we wanted to live.\xe2\x80\x9d \nThe cinematographer Robert Elswit said that while shooting There Will Be Blood he and director Paul Thomas Anderson looked at traditional film dailies rather than so-called digital dailies. In explaining the benefits of film dailies, Elswit provided an inadvertent explanation of why so many contemporary studio and independent movies look so bad: with film dailies \xe2\x80\x9cyou can\xe2\x80\x99t kid yourself about focus and all the other technical issues that can come back to bite you later when you go to do an IP [interpositive]. Or when you make a digital file into a negative, and you find out that those ten shots you sort of saw sharply with your D5 or HD dailies really weren\xe2\x80\x99t that sharp at all. And then, of course, the color space of motion picture film is completely different than digital color space.\xe2\x80\x9d \nIn Touch of Evil, the camera travelling across the border with both the newlywed Mr and Mrs Vargas and the blonde with \xe2\x80\x9cthis ticking in my head\xe2\x80\x9d/Henry Mancini/ Charlton Heston striding across the screen like the Colossus of Rhodes and Orson Welles looming in it like a colossus of cinema/the overhead shot of Vargas driving/Dietrich lighting a cigar (evoking von Sternberg) and eulogising Hank Quinlan (suggesting Welles).\nGrowing up in New York in the 1960s and 70s, my family only had a black-and-white TV, so wow, was I surprised when I first saw The Wisard of Oz in colour!'"

Should I include, say, Marker\xe2\x80\x99s La Jet\xc3\xa9e and Sans soleil, thereby at least giving documentary a nod? Necessary ruthlessness prevailed, uneasily. It was just as difficult to dispense altogether with Lang, Ozu, Welles, Bu\xc3\xb1uel\xe2\x80\xa6 the list could go on. But it was an attack of what might be called \xe2\x80\x98canon anxiety\xe2\x80\x99 that confronted me with the responsibility of choice that the task entails. This was provoked by the question of which Antonioni and Godard films to choose. The standard titles would be L\xe2\x80\x99Avventura and A bout de souffle; benchmark works enshrined in previous polls and therefore already canonical. That neither of the above is my favourite film by either director wasn\xe2\x80\x99t why I opted for The Passenger and Histoire(s) du cinema \xe2\x80\x93 the work of these two filmmakers is varied enough to include new canonical contenders. So, the rerelease of The Passenger in the last decade clinched it as regards Antonioni. As for Godard\xe2\x80\x99s Histoire(s), while ostensibly about cinema\xe2\x80\x99s past it is also, in its extraordinary collage of forms, very much about its future. So, a modest contribution to canon reformation, I hope.'"

It was Alain Resnais\xe2\x80\x99s first film in English and has a perfect script by David Mercer. With an impeccable cast of five principal actors \xe2\x80\x93 John Gielgud, Dirk Bogarde, David Warner, Elaine Stritch and Ellen Burstyn  it deals effortlessly with the problems of enacting the fantasies of a writer\xe2\x80\x99s imagination. It mixes places and time within single sequences to create an uncanny sense of dislocation but its brilliance is its leanness \xe2\x80\x93 not a single moment of excess.Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles is an extraordinary piece of cinema in which the tension is built up over the more than three hours of its duration through the unbearable monotony and domestic repetition in the daily life of the main character, played by Delphine Seyrig. It is rigorous, sparse and brutal and taught me a lot about economy of means and observation.Festen is the only film I ever went to see again immediately. It was radical in what it proposed with the new medium of digital and how it could change cinema and take it in new directions. My argument has always been that film and digital are different mediums and it\xe2\x80\x99s exciting when all that is different about them gets exploited to the full.It has been a long time since I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen Jubilee but I remember it with enormous affection. John Dee and Elizabeth I walking along together in an English garden before encountering the dystopia of punk London\xe2\x80\xa6 Derek Jarman had a very particular vision of England and always made filmmaking feel approachable and possible for anyone, as well as allowing it to be a place for very personal imagination.Un condamn\xc3\xa9 \xc3\xa0 mort s\xe2\x80\x99est \xc3\xa9chapp\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99 is a beautiful black and white film, full of psychological tension without recourse to too much action, and which immediately places you in that great French existential cinematic space which is so salutary and powerful.\nI love Le M\xc3\xa9pris in all its extravagance and indulgences, from the spoken title sequence at the beginning to Delerue\xe2\x80\x99s never-to-be-forgotten score. Bardot, Piccoli and Palance all become the characters they play so convincingly \xe2\x80\x93 superficial, spoilt, stylish but nonetheless monumental \xe2\x80\x93 that it is like watching a Greek tragedy unfold contemporaneously. It is also a film about film.Quince Tree Sun is a film about a painter painting a quince tree in his courtyard in what feels like the suburbs of a Spanish city. I have seen it only once but I remember it very clearly: the fruit hanging from the tree, which, as it ripens, sinks in the frame and frustrates the painter who is methodical in his process. It is a film about observing observation. I remember clearly the soundtrack of incidental urban life shifting gradually until dusk falls and televisions are switched on.Kes is a brilliant and unbearably poignant film, which shocked me when I first saw it at a young age for its realism and the unremitting toughness of Billy\xe2\x80\x99s life. It offers little redemption but is beautifully acted and depicted and showed me a different world, both culturally and cinematically.Close-up was my first experience of Iranian cinema and I loved it: the layers of documentary and intervention as well as the insight into Iranian life and, like the recent film A Separation, into Iranian justice and the Islamic court system. I found it immensely moving and it recalls for me the Fluxus artist Robert Filliou\xe2\x80\x99s premise that \xe2\x80\x98art [in this case \xe2\x80\x98cinema\xe2\x80\x99] is what makes life more interesting than art\xe2\x80\x99.The scene in the park in Blow-up is what I consider to be one of the best evocations of the creative impulse in cinema. David Hemmings grabs his camera on a whim and enters the park. It is a moment that is briefly empty of everything except, but for the wind in the trees, the desire to make photographs. Within this ecstatic narrative emptiness, and of course because of it, he finds something \xe2\x80\x93 in this case, the plot. It is a film about the materiality of a medium, which I hope won\xe2\x80\x99t become incomprehensible to a generation with no experience of the negative and the positive.'"

Whale's superb eye and tonal command are matched by a Karloff performance that manages to transmit both fragility and power.Full of iconic moments of pure cinema, pulp horror, carny noir, perverse melodrama \xe2\x80\x93 Freaks is still unclassifiable after many decades. Still sick, twisted, perverse and profoundly human. Pickled in a jar of bile, it contains Browning's view of the world at its purest.Shadow of the Doubt is one of the perfect Hitchcocks \xe2\x80\x93 the very first true American Gothic he made, and an eerie portrait of the world of the past being transformed by the touch of evil. As quintessentially American as Edward Hopper or Harper Lee.An exquisite engraving of human perversity, Greed is a monumental fable that will continue to influence cinema for decades to come. As modern and brutal today as it was the day it was released. A perfect reflection of the anxiety permeating the passage into the 20th century and the absolute dehumanisation that was to come.Modern Times: ballet, pantomime and absolute command of the cinematic medium. Chaplin manages to entertain and move the audience. In a sense it is the flip side of Murnau\xe2\x80\x99s Sunrise.La Belle et la B\xc3\xaate is the most perfect cinematic fable ever told. After M\xc3\xa9li\xc3\xa8s, only Cocteau has understood that perfect simplicity is required to tell a fairytale \xe2\x80\x93 and that nothing but the power of pure cinema is needed to create awe and wonder.With Goodfellas Scorsese gives birth to the 21st century in one of the most influential films of the last two decades. A movie that can be rewatched endlessly and remain fresh and surprising. Perfect in every aspect, behind and in front of the camera.I am certain that my favourite Bu\xc3\xb1uel is the Mexican period Bu\xc3\xb1uel and of all his films, Los olvidados and El (1953) shine the brightest. His surreal, anarchist spirit cuts the deepest when used against a conventional genre or a commercial constraint. This example of the golden era of Mexican cinema packs a punch, never flinching in depicting innocence suffocating by rules and concrete buildings. Ruthless Dickens as regurgitated by an atheist.Nosferatu is a symphony of fear indeed \xe2\x80\x93 and a symphony of perfect visual storytelling. The hypnotic nature of the film engrosses the audience into a trance. Along with Dreyer\xe2\x80\x99s Vampyr (1932), it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the two pillars for every vampiric film ever made. Whereas Dreyer concerns himself with the spiritual, Murnau's film has a tangible, physical component of corruption that makes evil immediate and real.A true classic has to be both intimate and universal. To speak about cinema through cinema requires a voice unwavering in its passion and purity. 8\xc2\xbd speaks as much about life as it does about art \xe2\x80\x93 and it makes certain to connect both. A portrait of the teller and his craft \xe2\x80\x93 a lustful, sweaty, gluttonous poem to cinema."""

Apart from my annual year\xe2\x80\x99s best lists, this is the only list I vote in \xe2\x80\x93 and have done since 1972.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a challenge. To add a title to the list I came up with in 2002, I must remove one. At one point in pondering this list, here\xe2\x80\x99s what I thought I would do: I would simply start all over with ten new films. But it was too much like a stunt. Lists are ridiculous, but if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to vote, you have to play the game. Besides, the thought of starting with a blank page and a list of all the films ever made fills me with despair. \nSo I decided there must be one new film. The two candidates, for me, were Charlie Kaufman\xe2\x80\x99s Synecdoche, New York and Terrence Malick\xe2\x80\x99s The Tree of Life. Like the Herzog, the Kubrick and the Coppola, they are films of almost foolhardy ambition. Like many of the films on my list, they were directed by the artist who wrote then. Like several of them, they attempt no less than to tell the story of an entire life. In Synecdoche, Kaufman does this with one of the most audacious sets ever constructed: an ever-expanding series of boxes or compartments with which the protagonist attempts to deal with the categories of his life. The film has the insight that we all deal with life in separate segments, defined by choice or compulsion, desire or fear, past or present. It is no less than a film about life. \nIn The Tree of Life, Malick boldly begins with the Big Bang and ends in an unspecified state of attenuated consciousness after death. The central section is the story of birth and raising a family. I could have chosen either film \xe2\x80\x93 I chose The Tree of Life because it\xe2\x80\x99s more affirmative and hopeful. I realise that isn\xe2\x80\x99t a defensible reasons for choosing one film over the other, but it is my reason, and making this list is essentially impossible, anyway.\nApart from any other motive for putting a movie title on a list like this, there is always the motive of propaganda: critics add a title hoping to draw attention to it, and encourage others to see it. For 2012, I suppose this is my propaganda title. I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s an important film, and will only increase in stature over the years.'"

I would also defend each and every one of them as an awe-inspiring work of art. I looked at my 2002 list and some of the titles are different, but the overall contours are much the same: Our Hospitality instead of Sherlock Jr. for Buster Keaton, film\xe2\x80\x99s greatest (and funniest) visual philosopher; the inevitable Citizen Kane, because no great movie has ever been more dynamic, ingenious and sheer fun \xe2\x80\x93 we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take it for granted (last time I also had The Magnificent Ambersons on my list, a film I love as much as Kane, but I wanted to make room for other auteurs); Kubrick\xe2\x80\x99s Barry Lyndon instead of 2001: A Space Odyssey because it is equally visionary and gorgeous, and perhaps slightly more poignant. Then there\xe2\x80\x99s Only Angels Have Wings, which shows Hawks\xe2\x80\x99 mastery of all genres in one picture: Western, adventure, romance, comedy, even musical. Trouble in Paradise is shimmering perfection \xe2\x80\x93 romantic comedy as rhythm and dance, dialogue as music and lyrics. Mizoguchi\xe2\x80\x99s Sansho Dayu is here because, as I\xe2\x80\x99ve often said, if there is a god, they are probably manifested in this movie; and Late Spring is possibly my favorite Ozu, a family tragicomedy (is there another kind?) about the sacrifices a father and daughter make for each other.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s a theme about men\xe2\x80\x99s distrust of women that runs through Hitchcock\xe2\x80\x99s Vertigo and Chinatown, and a noirish, Watergate-era cynicism that links the political/familial corruption of Chinatown with politics-as-entertainment in Nashville. \nI\xe2\x80\x99m not even going to begin discussing the painful omissions. Others will have to champion films such as Sunrise (F.W. Murnau, 1927), Kings of the Road (Wim Wenders, 1976), The Night of the Hunter (Charles Laughton, 1955), Playtime (Jacques Tati, 1967), The Scarlet Empress (Josef von Sternberg, 1934), Holiday (George Cukor, 1938), Miller\xe2\x80\x99s Crossing & No Country for Old Men (Joel & Ethan Coen, 1990 & 2007), Letter From an Unknown Woman & The Earrings of Madame de\xe2\x80\xa6 (Max Oph\xc3\xbcls, 1948 & 1953), Deep End (Jerzy Skolimowski, 1970) and Fast, Cheap & Out of Control (Errol Morris, 1997).'"

Wise words, and keep well in mind attempting this poll response, with one proviso: let\xe2\x80\x99s remove the \xe2\x80\x9cnearly\xe2\x80\x9d. The genuine torment of such assembly is made both easier and harder by a profound gap in my watching of the moving image from entire territories, a lack thrown into sharper relief when contemplating Mark Cousins\xe2\x80\x99 monumental overview The Story of Film (maybe one could choose that and wrangle thousands of titles into one).\nSo, naming the infinite losses first; Angelopoulos, Antonioni, Brakhage, Bu\xc3\xb1uel, Egoyan, Marker, Pasolini, Paradjanov, Peleshian; Beau Travail; The Gleaners and I; Horse Thief; Old Joy; Penda\xe2\x80\x99s Fen, Spirit of the Beehive; 32 Short Films about Glenn Gould; Yi Yi; comedies (especially silent, the Marx Brothers and Local Hero); the final scenes of Two Years at Sea and Werckmeister Harmonies\xe2\x80\xa6\nHowever, one of many things learnt from MC Film is advocacy. All polls, of course, are endorsements, but in these volume-saturated times, maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s a little more needed. Looking at my own selection, I\xe2\x80\x99m struck by several things straight off \xe2\x80\x93 its complete failure in chronology, gender and ethnicity terms, along with an unexpected grouping within the 1970s. I can\xe2\x80\x99t defend the former, but I can perhaps tease out the latter. In a way, all the works chosen explore, embody, speak for and salvage the human(e) in the face of threats and challenge on various scales. That this seam ran, delirious and wide-eyed, through that decade seems no coicidence; Utopia doesn\xe2\x80\x99t disappear once it\xe2\x80\x99s lost the streets. It regroups.\nAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s a sense of revelation to the titles chosen \xe2\x80\x93 the shock of vision in the fullest sense. It\xe2\x80\x99s an auteur-driven constellation and, to a degree, these titles stand for the larger oeuvre (not the case of Tale of Tales, which is simply the greatest animation ever made \xe2\x80\x93 don\xe2\x80\x99t take my word for it). That said, just as King Lear is the Shakespeare that speaks most urgently to our times, so it feels respectively with Stalker, 2001, The Thin Red Line.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s also a conscious wish to put at the centre methods of being through working (both behind and in front of the lens), hence the Watkins, the Fassbinder, the Tanner. I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s about finding films that speak both to the period we live in, while pointing towards futures worth inhabiting, through how they have created realities of imagination, action and a gaze towards light, regardless of subject. That Guzman\xe2\x80\x99s Nostalgia for the Light could (albeit with significant difficulty) be made now, is cause for great rejoicing.\nFinally, Three Colours: Red and Wings of Desire, films so loved they have entered the psyche and are almost indivisible from it: again, film as empathy.\nThe fact of these all (and so many more) in the world is both a great solace and spur. Onwards!'"

At the end though, I had to cave in to my subjective predilections, setting one sole benchmark for my choices: each and every entry in my list has altered the way I see and understand not only cinema but life. \nCitizen Kane is the most perfect movie ever made \xe2\x80\x93 a status it deserves to uphold for many generations to come.\nBergman is cinema\xe2\x80\x99s greatest filmmaker and Cries and Whispers is his ultimate statement on death, love and the human condition.\nRadical in every facet, Tati\xe2\x80\x99s anarchic magnum opus Play Time breaks every narrative rule, and is built on a stunning mise en sc\xc3\xa8ne that remains unmatched nearly half a century later. Most imperative of all, Play Time is a wondrous film that compels you to observe the world in a way you never have before.\nPostmodernism found a voice in Antonioni\xe2\x80\x99s revolutionary cinematic language and changed the face of arthouse cinema. The post-God world the visionary chronicler of the alienated and the disaffected valiantly confronts in L\xe2\x80\x99avventura speaks of truths filmmakers have tended to ignore ever since. \nVidor has never been given the acclaim he deserved, and The Crowd is a testament to the originality and singular vision of his work. It\xe2\x80\x99s an incisive probing of the individual\xe2\x80\x99s place in a mercilessly demanding society and remains as timeless as ever.\nDreyer was the first filmmaker to ask the big questions about life, God and the mysteries of the human soul, and in Ordet he delivered his most impassioned address on the elusive concept of faith.\nThe transience of time, the inevitability of separation and the pain of loss inform Ozu\xe2\x80\x99s most compassionate, most disarmingly tender picture Late Spring.\nAs things grew murkier and more ambivalent following the Egyptian revolution, the one film I kept revisiting was Alea\xe2\x80\x99s courageous Memories of Underdevelopment, which astutely reflects the sense of displacement in a stagnant nation lost in a purgatory of transition. \nYang is modern cinema\xe2\x80\x99s foremost humanist; his last work Yi Yi is a celebration of the joys, sorrows, triumphs and failures of characters no different than us. Amid the fear, isolation and uncertainty that defined the new century, Yang\xe2\x80\x99s deeply heartfelt epic was the one of the rare places of comfort. \nThe greatest of all Arab films, Chahine\xe2\x80\x99s groundbreaking Cairo Station freed Egyptian cinema from the throes of melodrama, capturing the soul of a self-destructive nation drowning in a bottomless ocean of social and political malaise.'"

Can you make a point more cinematically than that?\nTwo from Minnelli (and Cyd Charisse): The Band Wagon is the sophisticated epitome of the movie musical, packed with verve, wit, fun and dazzling dancing. Brigadoon, often berated for looking like a shortbread box, is as penetrating a dramatisation of the bumpy road to love as I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen. Van Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s cynicism perfectly balances Gene Kelly\xe2\x80\x99s swooning, the soundstage landscapes only add to the fairytale quality, and the ending defies prediction. \nTwo from Robert Bolt. A Man for All Seasons has the beauty and power of an oak. It rebukes moral expediency with brilliantly crafted dialogue and acting. Its message \xe2\x80\x93 to be wary of fashions \xe2\x80\x93 makes it inescapably unfashionable, and thereby a film for all seasons. Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s Daughter combines modern bite and unmatchable old-school splendour, and has my favourite end sequence of any film, a stirring mix of agony and hope. (Of the seven feature films Bolt wrote, five won the Oscar for Best Cinematography. Has anyone better grasped the art of screenwriting?)\nThe Exorcist and The Halfway House both (in different ways) unnerve and reassure us about being spiritual animals. Shadowlands is a humane and moving tale of faith, love and loss. The Old Dark House is a supremely atmospheric hoot, and Raiders of the Lost Ark is, to my mind, cinema\xe2\x80\x99s finest blast of escapism.\nDirectors horribly absent: Alfred Hitchcock, Preston Sturges, Roman Polanski.'"

It played once a year on TV; every kid in school was talking about it and we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see it. I still get so much joy from it. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to skip it as it\xe2\x80\x99s such an acknowledged classic but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to.It\xe2\x80\x99s a Wonderful Life is just a beautiful movie. It came out in 1948 and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t do so well \xe2\x80\x93 maybe because after World War II it seemed slight and not serious enough. It really didn\xe2\x80\x99t get played on TV until the late 70s. The first time I saw it I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe what a great movie it was. It was a ball in the 80s turning people on to it. Schindler\xe2\x80\x99s List: the most moving movie I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen. I almost didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see it because I knew what I would be in for. It was such a huge undertaking. How he made it look and feel so real was unbelievable. I\xe2\x80\x99ve met Spielberg a few times and I can\xe2\x80\x99t even talk to him, I\xe2\x80\x99m so in awe of him because of this film.Jaws: one of the most enjoyable movies ever and also the most horrifying. It kept me out of the ocean for years. There\xe2\x80\x99s not one boring part. The way special effects have developed, when I show it to my kids it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the same impact, but it still freaks me out. I live on the island where they shot it and Spielberg told me the entire time they were shooting it they had problems \xe2\x80\x93 with the weather, the shark, they went over budget, etc, and people back in LA weren\xe2\x80\x99t loving what they were seeing. He was getting reports that it was being considered an all-time-disaster. To think of what he achieved with that kind of stress and crap going on \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s great to hear as a filmmaker, because no-one really knows until they put it together. One Flew Over the Cuckoo\xe2\x80\x99s Nest: this is probably my favourite movie of all time. It\xe2\x80\x99s impressive on every level. The acting is insanely good. It\xe2\x80\x99s the best-cast film ever. I thought they\xe2\x80\x99d shot it an insane asylum; I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe they weren\xe2\x80\x99t actually insane people. The beauty of it is that this completely flawed guy, McMurphy, who drinks too much and robs thing and hangs with hookers, inside him is a humanity that touches these people, and they touch him. I just love that message; it\xe2\x80\x99s the ultimate redemption, that anybody is redeemable. It\xe2\x80\x99s just the most moving movie and most impressive, the directing, the acting. It\xe2\x80\x99s by far the best thing Jack Nicholson\xe2\x80\x99s ever done. He was in the zone. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this movie 15 or 20 times, and there\xe2\x80\x99s not one split second where he is not the guy, he is not reacting exactly.Midnight Cowboy: another movie in the same vein as the above. It\xe2\x80\x99s a study of two deeply flawed men, and the humanity inside, the humanity in every loser, every winner, everybody. It\xe2\x80\x99s heartbreaking, touching, funny and real. Like the best literature, it\xe2\x80\x99s just so finely tuned, so detailed and nuanced. It shows the power of filmmaking, and makes you proud to make movies.Reservoir Dogs: I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it until it came to video. I\xe2\x80\x99d heard it was a good movie but thought it would be slight, taking place in a room; yet it was so much bigger and better than that. It was a study of these men \xe2\x80\x93 again guys who are flawed; who was capable of what? How much you can read in a person? Who would break first? Who would be pushed furthest? I was sitting there the whole time trying to analyse these guys, trying to figure out who was good, who was bad, who was worse. Throughout I figured this young cop was obviously just a poor guy who\xe2\x80\x99d stumbled into this awful situation and knew nothing about anything. Then to find out at the end that he knew everything. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t break even when they cut his ear off: that was one of the most shocking movie moments of my life. The whole film is just spectacular. I don\xe2\x80\x99t normally like violent movies, but the violence was there for extremely important dramatic and plot reasons. It was necessary to tell that story and made me a lifelong fan of Quentin Tarantino.Airplane! I long-listed 20 movies, and went back and forth between them. I realised at one time I had no comedies on here, and it always bugs me that comedies are second-class citizens. Comedians never get the due we deserve, and I find myself adopting the same prejudice. Then I realised there are comedies that changed me in a big way. The following are my three favourite comedy movies of all time, which I think everyone will enjoy.For the record, Something Wild is one of my favourite movies, but for whatever reason a lot of people don\xe2\x80\x99t react to it the way I do, so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t include it on the list. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s not for everybody, just as I know Bruno is not for everybody but personally I love Bruno. Bruno makes me laugh more than almost every movie out there. The thing I love about Bruno is the bravery, the courage to make that movie. The guy could have gotten killed two or three times making that movie \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s what I was laughing at. The fact that he would go that far for his art impresses me.I had a hard time knocking it down to three \xe2\x80\x93 I love Some Like it Hot and Animal House, but these three made the biggest impact on me. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be writing this if Airplane! had never been made. It made me think, \xe2\x80\x9cWow, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think you could do that!\xe2\x80\x9d They just went crazy. I love the no-holds-barred humour.I remember seeing the Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams interviewed on Letterman and thinking \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s me, I could do this.\xe2\x80\x9d It was the first time in my life it had ever occurred to me I could do it. I\xe2\x80\x99d always had this impression that filmmakers were guys with bullhorns and berets; they weren\xe2\x80\x99t me. Abrahams and the Zuckers were so down-to-earth and typical, yet they had this dream, went for it and achieved it. I probably laughed more in that movie than any in my entire life. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it holds up as well because that kind of humour has been done a lot, by the Zuckers and others. Still, at the time it blew my mind, it was just an hour and a half of non-stop laughs.Borat: I\xe2\x80\x99m obviously a big Sacha Baron Cohen fan. His style of comedy is completely original. He\xe2\x80\x99s a force. Borat is so lovable he could get away with murder. People didn\xe2\x80\x99t love Bruno as much (although I did). Cohen and Larry Charles are such brave filmmakers; they talk about race, gender, anything, and ultimately they\xe2\x80\x99re making light of these prejudices. Borat is a ground-breaking movie and it definitely gave me more laughs than any other movie in the list.Sideways: one of the best scripts of all time \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s such a simple story, and Jim Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s writing is superb. Everything Alexander Payne does is interesting and this is his best. The characters are sensational, as is the casting. He could have got Brad Pitt but he got a couple of slumps. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it four or five times now. I expected it to go down a notch, but no holes second or third time round. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never met anyone that didn\xe2\x80\x99t love it. Honorable mentions go to The Sixth Sense, Titanic, Animal House, Some Like it Hot, The Graduate and Something Wild.These are the ten movies that I love and they\xe2\x80\x99re for everybody; whenever I show them to people they love them too. It\xe2\x80\x99s a little boring, this list: I\xe2\x80\x99m not coming up with movies you\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard of. And these are not necessarily my favourite movies. When Bruno opened my wife and I went to see it. We\xe2\x80\x99re not easily offended and we laughed our asses off; some people walked past and asked us what we\xe2\x80\x99d seen and I said \xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like it.\xe2\x80\x9d I know my ten films may be obvious choices but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be a dick and not pick them just because they\xe2\x80\x99re successful.We didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a movie theatre when I was young \xe2\x80\x93 the nearest was 30 miles away and we\xe2\x80\x99d go twice a year. So my main influences was television, especially the Andy Griffith show.Bobby [Farrelly] and I are quite different in a lot of ways. I reckon five of my films would be on his list \xe2\x80\x93 Jaws definitely. Something Wild is why we cast Jeff Daniels in Dumb & Dumber \xe2\x80\x93 but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t quite share my passion for it. I feel bad it\xe2\x80\x99s not in the top ten, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not for everybody.'"

Everything else seems a little flat after you see this.\nMeyer\xe2\x80\x99s no-nonsense exploitation classic Faster, Pussycat, Kill! Kill! is near flawless: every line of dialogue (and voiceover) a snappy, quotable snarl of contempt; MTV-editing before MTV was ever conceived of; and a truly remarkable cast \xe2\x80\x93 has any film had a better antihero than Tura Satana? Despite Meyer\xe2\x80\x99s rep, no nudity is involved \xe2\x80\x93 instead, it\xe2\x80\x99s Girl Power run rampant. One of the few cult classics to be even better than the fans suggest.\nMade in the wake of Faces of Death, the documentary The Killing of America should be equally throwaway. Instead it\xe2\x80\x99s a devastating, compulsive and apocalyptic look at American gun culture that unsurprisingly never saw release in the US. Cynical, angry and often quite disturbing, the film mixes news footage, interviews and powerful narration (written by Leonard and Chieko Schrader and voiced by Chuck Riley) to devastating effect. A masterclass in documentary making and a fascinating historical study of American life and death in the second half of the 20th century.\nAlain Renais\xe2\x80\x99 fascinating, ambiguous puzzle of a film, Last Year At Marienbad is one of those that lodges itself into your mind and refuses to budge. It\xe2\x80\x99s a work of beauty that transcends genre and reveals something new every time.\nGodard\xe2\x80\x99s cynical study of marital collapse and artistic integrity \xe2\x80\x93 or the loss of it \xe2\x80\x93 Contempt is a deliciously multi-layered tale, loosely confessional and clearly personal. Brigitte Bardot is made into an object of desire, albeit an increasingly unobtainable one, while Jack Palance plays every Hollywood producer stereotype with relish. All Godard\xe2\x80\x99s films of this era are great, but this is the essential one.\nIn Paris, Texas, Wenders and screenwriters Sam Shepard and L.M. Kit Carson created a film that blatantly tears at the heartstrings but does so within the context of a somewhat leftfield story of madness and separation \xe2\x80\x93 the final revelations are hardly the stuff of romantic drama. Beautiful to look at, with a perfect score by Ry Cooder and with career-best performances by Harry Dean Stanton and Nastassja Kinski, it\xe2\x80\x99s a film that will have the hardest-hearted viewers blubbing unashamedly more than once.\nBu\xc3\xb1uel\xe2\x80\x99s biting social satire The Exterminating Angel is as pertinent as ever, losing none of its edge as it portrays how quickly civilisations collapse under pressure and how we are all trapped by social convention. It\xe2\x80\x99s both terrifying and hilarious.\nA masterclass in horror film making, Tobe Hooper\xe2\x80\x99s The Texas Chain Saw Massacre spends its first half building tension and the second half piling on the madness in a way that no other movie has ever come close to matching. You can almost taste the heat and the decay, and there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a second that isn\xe2\x80\x99t perfect.\nOne of a handful of \xe2\x80\x98horror\xe2\x80\x99 films that deal with a young girl\xe2\x80\x99s loss of innocence and transition into womanhood (The Company of Wolves, Lemora: A Child\xe2\x80\x99s Tale of the Supernatural), Valerie And Her Week Of Wonders is a strange, subversive, joyful, earthy fantasy with a remarkable dreamlike quality. A delight.\nWoman In The Dunes is a gorgeous, unsettling tale of obsession \xe2\x80\x93 sexual and otherwise. Minimalist in approach but utterly absorbing, this is one of those films that burns itself into your mind on first viewing and quietly alters the way you view the art of cinema.\nNarrowing down a list of the greatest films to just ten is tough \xe2\x80\x93 my original shortlist came to 23, and I could mount a passionate argument in favour of each title. But ten it is. And then the question is: do you choose the most important, the most artistically valid or the films you love? In the end, I\xe2\x80\x99ve gone with the latter, because surely cinema should speak to us on a personal level \xe2\x80\x93 although I would argue that all the above films have both artistic and historical value too. These are all films I can watch continually, spotting new things and appreciating them every bit as much as I did the first time \xe2\x80\x93 films that I will passionately defend against detractors (and some of these films have plenty of those!) and will regularly force on to partners, houseguests and work colleagues. And, in one way or another, these are all films that changed how I saw cinema \xe2\x80\x93 as an artform, as a unique viewing experience, as a taboo-confronting medium and as an emotional outlet.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to see certain directors I love (David Cronenberg, Stanley Kubrick, David Lynch) not represented, and I\xe2\x80\x99m resigned to the fact that some people will look at this list and slowly shake their heads, appalled at my taste in film.

All of the future search of experimentalism is contained within it. The story moves ahead in a permanent tension between novelty (in terms of style and the changes in Russian life at the time) and the big frame of history in which the action takes place.\nThe seeds of naturalism and the psychological exploration of human soul are present in Greed. It is full of innovations in the areas of photography, acting and the depiction of hallucinations, violence and madness. The film was made exactly at the edge of sound, announcing it and demanding its presence.\nVertigo is the perfect example of classical film style. An incredible use of symbolism throughout the fable creates a new space of intertwining reality and fiction, truth and nightmares, and immediacy and dreams; its story is based on the meaning of love and its relation to loss. And it has a perfect script, accurate like clockwork.\nA narrative experiment in history told from three different (and opposed between them) points of view, truth and lies run along the story of Rash\xc3\xb4mon. It has a beautiful, powerful script and staging.\nThe extraordinary use of the word, the silences, the contrast of black and white, the performances hiding turbulent emotion \xe2\x80\x93 all these make The Word a great example of the art of cinema. A true lesson.\nA Clockwork Orange abounds with invention: the irreverence, the break with convention, the use of parody and the grotesque as stylistic procedures, the cult and mockery of violence, and the insertion of elements of the mass culture. It also has a superb script, spectacular staging and unforgettable performances.\nGreat cinema has to be about discovery: of new cultures, of new ways of thinking, of feeling the weight of the light, of the course of time, of colour, of a means of relating a history and even of how to perform that for the screen. I believe that Yeleen is the finest example of this.\nBlack God, White Devil combines to great effect: the explosion of popular culture; narration; hallucinations rooted in mystic delirium; a mix of syncretic religion; magic; popular fable; epic poetry; and a deep portrait of poverty, rage and the struggle of poor people in rural areas. It is popular and avant garde at the same time.\nFew works have gathered so many elements that would come to transform film narration as Breathless. Even today, we feel that Godard reinvented the art of the cinema, pushing it to the boundaries of risk and experimentation.\nIn The Pier we see the possible future of human race via a fable about images and imagination. A feast of stills with few seconds of moving image, it takes an incredible risk in a bet for dreams and freedom. All this in a beautiful circular story of love and memory told from the ruins.'"

It is Catch-22 for the screen.\nHugo is pure cinema from start to finish \xe2\x80\x93 a summary of Scorsese\xe2\x80\x99s obsessions and a love letter to film just as we say farewell to the process. Time will pronounce.\nLes Demoiselles De Rochefort is the only musical that might replace Singin\xe2\x80\x99 in the Rain in the poll, featuring as it does emotional joy in real locations, without guile or irony.\nAs much a coded warning of lost dreams, guilt and shame as a love story \xe2\x80\x93 Brief Encounter is gay history personified and mercifully closed.\nAnd Your Mother Too is the only film I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen that really catches the wasted freedom of being young.\nTopsy-Turvy replaces 8\xc2\xbd as the best illustration of the creative process at work. Even low comedy can prove sublime if treated seriously.\nNo finer ghost story has ever been filmed than The Innocents, or one more psychologically ambiguous. It repays further visits and has the most unnerving kiss in cinema history.\nWith more quotable lines than any other comedy, it\xe2\x80\x99s time The Producers is admitted to the pantheon. It\xe2\x80\x99s worth recalling that it opened within living memory of the Holocaust.'"

For instance, The Son\xe2\x80\x99s style thinks empathetically (using framing and movement) about a character trying to find his own empathy. The elliptical thinking of The Intruder allows the filmgoer to feel an idea of intrusion. The Second Circle almost seems to take place in the consciousness of the tired grieving son. Mauvais Sang and The Scent of Green Papaya think about love with colour. Silent Light and Stalker think meditatively about meditative living \xe2\x80\x93 their edits are at times profound choices. While Europa, Werkmeister Harmonies and Irreversible are just stunning feats of cinema; the latter is the most astonishingly phenomenological film of recent years, a film that breaths and pulsates through image and sound.'"
